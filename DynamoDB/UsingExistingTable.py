# It is also possible to create a DynamoDB.Table resource from an existing table:
import boto3

# Get the service resource.
dynamodb = boto3.resource('dynamodb')

# Instantiate a table resource object without actually
# creating a DynamoDB table. Note that the attributes of this table
# are lazy-loaded: a request is not made nor are the attribute
# values populated until the attributes
# on the table resource are accessed or its load() method is called.
table = dynamodb.Table('users_workshop')

# Print out some data about the table.
# This will cause a request to be made to DynamoDB and its attribute
# values will be set based on the response.
print(table.creation_date_time)
# Expected Output (Please note that the actual times will probably not match up):
# 2015-06-26 12:42:45.149000-07:00
